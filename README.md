# Project Overview

This project aims to automate the process of extracting CEO pay ratio data from SEC filings, analyzing the data, and drawing relationships using GPT API. It consists of three main steps:

1. Indicating the URLs to access the required data.
2. Web scraping to extract specific keywords ('pay ratio').
3. Using GPT API to analyze the data and draw relationships.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `extract_url.ipynb`
This notebook is responsible for identifying and indicating the URLs that need to be accessed for data extraction. The user provides input regarding the company or SEC filing, and the notebook generates or extracts the relevant URLs.

**Key Functions:**
- Input: Company names or SEC filing references.
- Output: List of URLs pointing to the required data.

### 2. `web_scraping.ipynb`
This notebook handles the web scraping process. It accesses the URLs identified in the previous step and extracts the keyword 'pay ratio' from the HTML content of the web pages.

**Key Functions:**
- Input: List of URLs.
- Processing: Extracts content from the web pages, specifically looking for the keyword 'pay ratio.'
- Output: Data containing instances of the keyword 'pay ratio' and surrounding context.

### 3. `gpt_api.ipynb`
This notebook leverages the GPT API to analyze the extracted data. The analysis focuses on drawing relationships between the extracted pay ratio data and other relevant financial metrics. The output can include regression analysis, data visualizations, and text-based insights generated by GPT.

**Key Functions:**
- Input: Data extracted from web scraping.
- Processing: Uses GPT API to analyze the data, looking for patterns and relationships.
- Output: Visualizations, regression models, and narrative insights.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Extract URLs:**
   - Run the `extract_url.ipynb` to generate a list of relevant URLs based on the desired companies or SEC filings.
   
2. **Web Scraping:**
   - Execute `web_scraping.ipynb` using the list of URLs generated in the first step. This will extract the relevant 'pay ratio' data from the web pages.
   
3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Finally, run `gpt_api.ipynb` to analyze the scraped data. This notebook will utilize the GPT API to identify relationships and generate insights.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `openai`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.
